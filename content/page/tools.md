This page links to tools that I find useful

**Open Source**

[Kali](https://www.kali.org) is great for new and old hacking hands.  Excellent for getting bootstrapped when you don't have time to build something more custom and very useful as an instructive tool.

**Commercial**

[Evernote](https://wwww.evernote.com/) as my info capture bucket and search.  I don't use tags: clip and search for me.

[Burp Suite Pro](https://www.portswigger.net/) is a web security testing tool for security professionals.  The commercial version is excellent and the mainstay for many penetration testers.  A free version is also available.
