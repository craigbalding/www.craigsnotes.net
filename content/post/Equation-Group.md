[Kaspersky publishes a FAQ](http://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf) to accompany their report on the Equation Group:

> The Equation group is a highly sophisticated threat actor that has been engaged in multiple CNE (computer network exploitation) operations dating back to 2001, and perhaps as early as 1996. The Equation group uses multiple malware platforms, some of which surpass the well-known “Regin” threat in complexity and sophistication. The Equation group is probably one of the most sophisticated cyber attack groups in the world; and they are the most advanced threat actor we have seen.
